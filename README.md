# IntroToTypeScript

TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language designed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript, which means that it extends the capabilities of JavaScript by adding features such as type annotations, interfaces, classes, and more. TypeScript is designed to address the limitations of JavaScript, such as its dynamic typing and lack of support for advanced object-oriented programming concepts. With TypeScript, developers can catch errors early in the development process and benefit from better tooling support, which can increase productivity and reduce the risk of bugs. TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript code and can be run on any browser or platform that supports JavaScript. It is widely used for developing large-scale applications, especially those based on Angular, React, or Node.js frameworks.
